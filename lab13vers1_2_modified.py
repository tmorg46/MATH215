"""**Downloading image data**

The simplest way to load the image into Colab is to first download it as a .png file to your local computer by clicking the link

https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1hlAEhTsqfvYX3aGFgRgFJF_gO-U5c0gH

This will allow you to download the image as a .png file.  In the top left corner of this screen you should see a little file folder icon.   Selecting it opens a new window to the left of the notebook with three tabs: "Upload", "Refresh", and "Mount Drive". Select "Upload".  This should bring up a window that allows you to select the file "Lab13Image.png" from your local machine, which will upload the file to your notebook.  You will need to do this again if you decide to close your notebook and reopen it at a later time.

**Import the image and convert it to an array**

The following cell imports the png image and creates two arrays.  The first array is a 3-dimensional array, which you can think of as three matrices, each of which describes one of three colors for the image (red, green, and blue).  The second line of the cell converts the image to grayscale, which can be represented by a single matrix, whose entries range between 0 and 1 and represent how dark or bright the corresponding pixel should be.

"""**STOP!  BEFORE YOU SUBMIT THIS LAB:**  Go to the "Runtime" menu at the top of this page, and select "Restart and run all".  If any of the cells produce error messages, you will either need to fix the error(s) or delete the code that is causing the error(s).  Then use "Restart and run all" again to see if there are any new errors.  Repeat this until no new error messages show up.

**You are not ready to submit until you are able to select "Restart and run all" without any new error messages showing up.  Your code will not be able to be graded if there are any error messages.**

To submit your lab for grading you must first download it to your compute as .py file.  In the "File" menu select "Download .py".  The resulting file can then be uploaded to http://www.math.byu.edu:30000 for grading.
